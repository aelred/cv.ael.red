\section{PERSONAL STATEMENT}

A motivated and skilled software developer with experience in backend development primarily in Java, Python and Rust, looking to resume my career after a break travelling and volunteering this year.

\section{EXPERIENCE}

\normalsize{\section{November 2015 - March 2018}}
{\bf Grakn Labs} (\href{http://grakn.ai/}{http://grakn.ai/}) \\
Core Developer \\
\begin{itemize}

\item
Designed and developed the query language Graql (\href{https://github.com/aelred/grakn}{https://github.com/aelred/grakn}), a declarative pattern-based query language that operates on the Grakn knowledge graph.

\item
Graql was implemented in Java, using Tinkerpop and ANTLR. Additionally, remote clients were implemented using protocol buffers and gRPC to stream query results over HTTP. Remote clients were implemented in Java, Python and Haskell.

\item
Built an interpreter for CTM (compact topic map) files using ANTLR in order to support loading schemas into the knowledge graph.

\item
Worked on query execution in the Moogi prototype project - a movie semantic search engine used to demonstrate our software stack. Required very careful study of Tinkerpop to get the best performance.

\item
Helped implement company-wide processes such as code reviews and automated testing using Travis CI and Jenkins.
