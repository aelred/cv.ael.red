Dear Sir or Madam,

I would like to be considered for this software engineering internship. I meet many of the listed preferred qualifications: I know Java and Python very well and have a little experience with C++. I've recently been introduced to competitive programming, which has taught me a lot about algorithms and problem-solving in general. I have some experience with Linux, but only as an end-user and not as a software developer.

I have a big interest in machine learning and would love to learn more, especially to see how it can be applied to the huge amounts of data Google has access to.

Thank you very much for considering my application.

Yours faithfully,
Felix Chapman
