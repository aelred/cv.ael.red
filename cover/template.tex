\opening{Dear Sir or Madam,}

I am writing to apply for TODO. I am a MEng Computer Science student in my
fourth and final year at Southampton University. I have achieved marks in the
top 10\% in all previous years, having previously gained an A* in A-level
Computing.

I would like to be considered for TODO. I have experience using TODO, but
want to learn more about TODO.

I am considered to be fair, approachable and friendly and I work well
individually and in a group; I'm occasionally picked as the leader for group
work and last semester I worked in a team of seven people on a game based on
Pong to teach typing (which ought to be available here:
\url{http://ultimate-karma-394.appspot.com/}). Outside university, I enjoy
playing the piano, reading and playing video games.

Thank you very much for considering my application and CV and I hope to hear
from you.

\closing{Yours faithfully,}

\end{letter}
